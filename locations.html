        Built in 1889 for the Exposition Universelle, the Eiffel Tower (Tour Eiffel) has become the main symbol of Paris. It's also the most visited attraction in the world.The Eiffel Tower is a wrought iron tower that stands 1,063 ft (324 m) tall. It was designed for the Exposition Universelle, a world fair held in Paris in 1889. It's currently the most famous symbol of Paris.If it’s your first time in Paris, going up the Eiffel Tower is a must. Visitors can choose to go up using the Tower lift or the stairs. However, before making your mind up on how you want to visit the monument, it's important to keep in mind that there are 1,665 steps to the top.

        If you decide to take the stairs, you can only visit the second floor. Although the stairs admission ticket is cheaper, the difference is not worthwhile and we recommend taking the elevator.
        
        The best moment to enjoy the breathtaking views of Paris is early in the morning to avoid the lines or at dusk, when visitors will see Paris lit up.

    <p>
        Statue of Liberty, formally Liberty Enlightening the World, colossal statue on Liberty Island in the Upper New York Bay, U.S., commemorating the friendship of the peoples of the United States and France. Standing 305 feet (93 metres) high including its pedestal, it represents a woman holding a torch in her raised right hand and a tablet bearing the adoption date of the Declaration of Independence (July 4, 1776) in her left. The torch, which measures 29 feet (8.8 metres) from the flame tip to the bottom of the handle, is accessible via a 42-foot (12.8-metre) service ladder inside the arm (this ascent was open to the public from 1886 to 1916). An elevator carries visitors to the observation deck in the pedestal, which may also be reached by stairway, and a spiral staircase leads to an observation platform in the figure’s crown. A plaque at the pedestal’s entrance is inscribed with a sonnet, “The New Colossus” (1883) by Emma Lazarus.

    <h1>Taj mahal</h1>

    <p>
        The Taj Mahal is located on the right bank of the Yamuna River in a vast Mughal garden that encompasses nearly 17 hectares, in the Agra District in Uttar Pradesh. It was built by Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his wife Mumtaz Mahal with construction starting in 1632 AD and completed in 1648 AD, with the mosque, the guest house and the main gateway on the south, the outer courtyard and its cloisters were added subsequently and completed in 1653 AD. The existence of several historical and Quaranic inscriptions in Arabic script have facilitated setting the chronology of Taj Mahal. For its construction, masons, stone-cutters, inlayers, carvers, painters, calligraphers, dome builders and other artisans were requisitioned from the whole of the empire and also from the Central Asia and Iran. Ustad-Ahmad Lahori was the main architect of the Taj Mahal.

    </div>
    <p>Dubai is an ideal holiday destination for families, with theme parks, beaches, Friday brunches and more to keep everyone happy. The famous Burj Khalifa, the tallest building in the world, is well worth the entrance fee. Burj Al-Arab, often touted as the world's only 7-star hotel, remains underwhelming. Similarly, the Aquaventure Water Park at the Palms Atlantis Hotel is not to be missed. Jumeriah Beach Residence is well established as Dubai's most popular beachfront, and its close proximity to a whole host of restaurants, cafes and shops make it more than worthy of its status.</p>

    <p>The charming city of Geneva comes with a plethora of attractions and tremendous natural beauty that makes every traveler fall in love with it. However, because of this overabundance of attractions, it becomes difficult for the backpackers to determine where to go first. Most of them generally miss out on all the best things that this fantastic city has to offer. The capital of Switzerland and a beautiful lakeside city, Geneva is home to many international organisations like the UN.</p>

    <p>Port Blair is an alluring destination for tourists as it includes a host of attractive locales. There are shimmering but clean beaches, beaches that defy the ferocity of sea and let tourists swim leisurely, relics of colonial power and oppression, many must-go museums, libraries, coral reefs, and more.</p>

    <p>The capital of one of the most powerful ancient empires in the world, Rome is a fascinating place that has inspired people to visit for millennia. With incredible works of art, a leisurely pace of life and world-renowned cuisine, the Eternal City is worth a visit at least once, though it would take a lifetime to see all it has to offer.</p>
