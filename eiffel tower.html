            Built in 1889 for the Exposition Universelle, the Eiffel Tower (Tour Eiffel) has become the main symbol of Paris. It's also the most visited attraction in the world.The Eiffel Tower is a wrought iron tower that stands 1,063 ft (324 m) tall. It was designed for the Exposition Universelle, a world fair held in Paris in 1889. It's currently the most famous symbol of Paris.If itâ€™s your first time in Paris, going up the Eiffel Tower is a must. Visitors can choose to go up using the Tower lift or the stairs. However, before making your mind up on how you want to visit the monument, it's important to keep in mind that there are 1,665 steps to the top.
    
            If you decide to take the stairs, you can only visit the second floor. Although the stairs admission ticket is cheaper, the difference is not worthwhile and we recommend taking the elevator.
            
            The best moment to enjoy the breathtaking views of Paris is early in the morning to avoid the lines or at dusk, when visitors will see Paris lit up.
